# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run: 
The Cumplo Chanllenge Code

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### Technology used:

Web Application made in React.
I used Bootstrap V4 for the front end part, also I used some Material UI Open [https://material-ui.com/es/](https://material-ui.com/es/) for some
modules like the Modal Component, also I used Material UI Icons [https://material-ui.com/es/components/material-icons/](https://material-ui.com/es/components/material-icons/).

### Notes:
I notice some erros in te API, for example if you want to get the previous page, the link that the API gave is the get employees by branch, not te previous link page,
Some fix in the front end secction will be take the number of the URL and decrease that number until the previous page is Null, but the problem here is if there 
are more than one digit number in the url the count will fail.
